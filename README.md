### Example

Displays an animation for a random seed number.

https://samma.github.io/flow-fields/

### To render video and play with the code

Download the code zip-file, then open sketch.js and set "enabledSaveVideos = true" on line 13, then open index.html in your browser. It will take a few minutes to render completely and the tab must remain open. The video will download when the 16 second render has been completed.

To inspect a particular seed number, set for example "startSeed = 1" on line 41 in sketch.js

Try and play with the other numbers in "createFlowFieldWithRandomSettings()" function in sketch.js to make whole new artworks
